## Installation

Clone the Repo or Download the Zip File from the Repo

[ZIP](https://github.com/willysyztem/CEN4010/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) if you are lazy...

### Windows

For windows user a `setup.bat` has been added which will create your virtual environment for you.

![](https://i.ibb.co/zHDRw8S/setup-gif.gif)

To ensure that everything runs smoothly, please download:

- The latest [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3102/) version
- The latest [postgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/) version (windows)

**_Note: DB ISSUES_**

If you are experiencing issues with the `setup.bat` not loading correctly is because you might have not configured your database locally.
By Default the DB Config is set to

![](https://i.ibb.co/qRWQDW6/code1.png)

This will automatically use the Heroku DB.

## PLEASE USE YOUR LOCAL DB FOR TESTING!

### MAC

MAC setup file coming soon.
For now run it on the terminal üë®‚Äçüíª

- `cd CEN4010` Go inside project folder
- `python3 -m venv venv` Create your virtual environment
- `source ./venv/bin/activate/` Activate your virtual environment
- `pip install -r requirements.txt` Install dependencies
- `cd app` Go inside app folder
- `uvicorn main:app --reload` Run uvicorn server

When uvicorn is online, go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` on your browser to use SwaggerUI

- The latest [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3102/) version
- The latest [postgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/macosx/) version (mac)



## Documentation

In here you will find briefly what the folder structure is for our project

![](https://i.ibb.co/tM9KtKj/Screen-Shot-2022-02-18-at-3-20-28-PM.png)

### App folder

In the app folder you will find all the components that are needed for our restfulAPI
self explanatory.

### Config folder

In our config folder you will find all the settings needed for our resfulAPI such as

**FASTAPI SETTINGS**

- `PROJECT_TITLE: str = 'Bookstore RestAPI'` Our restfulAPI title for FASTAPI
- `PROJECT_VERSION: str = '0.1.0'` Our version of our API

**DB SETTINGS**

**_CHANGE IF YOU KNOW WHAT IN THE WORLD YOU ARE DOING_**

- `POSTGRES_LOCAL: bool = True` `True` if you want to use local, `False` for Heroku
- `POSTGRES_USER: str` postgres user most likely your machine name, Heroku is set already
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD: str` If you set a local password put it here, Heroku is set already
- `POSTGRES_SERVER: str` Server you created locally, Heroku is set already
- `POSTGRES_PORT: str = '5432'` Defaul port dont change
- `POSTGRES_DB: str` Databse you created locally, Heroku is set already

### DB folder

In our DB folder you will find our **database.py** and **models.py**

Do not touch **database.py** (skipping)

### Router folder

In our Routers folder you will find all the routers creating that get added to the api
this is done by creating a `my_router.py` file 

In your router file, you need to create a router using

`router = APIRouter()`

Instead of using `@app` decorator like in your `main.py` you will use `@router`

ex:

`@router.get()`

**models.py**

Here you will introduce a new model that is going to be sent over to the database. This is going
to create a table based on the model.

If you need to recreate another model for the database copy the `User` model already created and 
modify it to your needs. For extra help use [sqlalchemy](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/orm/tutorial.html#create-a-schema) docs

**schemas.py**

Here you will introduce a new schema that is going to be used to validate data that is sent or shown
in the api

**utils.py**

Here will be utility functions to use throughout our app
currently we have 

- `hash()` Hashes plain text passwords using bcrypt
- `verify()` Compares plain text passwords and hashed password store in db

**oauth2.py**

This is our open auth class to create access tokens and verify access tokens
using jwt token format

The only Thing you need to change here would be the `SECRET_KEY` to
one shared by the group.

for more info on this read [FastAPI Security](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/security/oauth2-jwt/)

**main.py**
This is the brains of our backend restfulAPI here you will be adding your API endpoints.

To add your api

import your router

ex: 

`from routers import my_router.py`

and inside our `start_app()` include your router to the `app` object

ex:

`app.inclue_router(my_router.router)`

## Authentication

Authentication has been added to our backend
meaning that only authorized logged in users are able to use
the API

![](https://i.ibb.co/Btm1GXP/authentication.gif)

add authentication to your api add the end of the api functions
using `Depends(oauth2.get_current_user)`
